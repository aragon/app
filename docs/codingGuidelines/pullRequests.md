# Pull Requests

Follow the guidelines below when opening and merging pull requests:

-   Subject line must be prefixed with a lowercase type (`fix`, `feat`, ..) followed by a colon and a space.
-   The type `feat` must be used when a commit adds a new feature to the application or library.
-   The type `fix` must be used when a commit represent a bug fix to your application or library.
-   Types other than `feat` and `fix` may be used as defined in the
    [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).
-   When available, the related Jira ticket must be specified as scope and enclosed in parenthesis, e.g.
    `fix(APP-1234):`. Multiple Jira tickets must be specified as a comma-separated list , e.g. `fix(APP-12,APP-34):`.
-   A description must follow the type/scope prefix and describes the code changes.
-   The description must be capitalized and use the imperative mood.

**⚠️ NOTE**: When merging a pull request containing only one commit, Github will suggest using the commit name instead
of the PR name. Ensure that the commit name follows the commit guidelines above.

## Examples:
