# Aragon App - Next

The Aragon App is an easy-to-use platform that empowers users to create and manage their Decentralized Autonomous
Organizations (DAOs). The application interacts with the [Aragon OSx](https://github.com/aragon/osx) through the
integration of the [Aragon OSx SDK](https://github.com/aragon/sdk) and the
[Aragon Governance UI Kit](https://github.com/aragon/gov-ui-kit) library.

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: Version >= 22
- EditorConfig: Ensure your IDE has EditorConfig support enabled

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the app running on your machine:

1. Enable Corepack (one-time setup):

```bash
corepack enable
```

2. Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

**Note**: pnpm will automatically use the correct Node.js version as configured in the project.

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and populate it with the required environment variables. Use the
   `.env.example` file as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start the development server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. Access the Aragon App by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Other available commands include:

- Lint the code:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

- Build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

- Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot find module" errors:**

- pnpm uses strict dependency resolution
- All imports must be declared in package.json
- Solution: `pnpm add <package-name>`

**Build script errors:**

- Some packages need approval: `pnpm approve-builds`
- Check `.npmrc` for `public-hoist-pattern` if needed

**Installation issues:**

- Clear cache: `pnpm store prune`
- Reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`

**Node version issues:**

- pnpm automatically manages Node.js versions
- If issues persist, ensure Corepack is enabled: `corepack enable`

## Environments

The Aragon App supports various environments, each with its unique URL and deployment trigger. Here are the available
environments:

| Name           | Url                         | Deployment trigger                           | Environment file  |
